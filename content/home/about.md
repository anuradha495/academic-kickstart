# About

I am currently pursuing graduate studies in [Petroleum Engineering](https://www.pge.utexas.edu/) at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). My research is focused on applying advanced experimental techniques and modelling the behavior of foams used in enhanced oil recovery.

Previously, I worked as a Process Engineer at [Sulzer Chemtech](https://www.sulzer.com/en/shared/about-us/2017/08/16/12/50/myr17-chemtech), where I designed basic engineering packages for various distillation units.

I graduated from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/), India in 2016 with a degree in Chemical Engineering.
